This code was converted to Python3 from the Python2 code from the

Multiplicative Persistence: If one step is multiplying a number's digits
together to get a new number, how many steps does it take to get to a
single digit number?

So far, the number two-hundred seventy-seven trillion, seven-hundred
seventy-seven billion, seven-hundred eighty-eight million, eight-hundred
eighty-eight thousand, eight-hundred ninety-nine (277777788888899) has a
multiplicative persistence of eleven.

Matt Parker (from Numberphile) challenged the world to find a number
with a multiplicative persistence of twelve.
