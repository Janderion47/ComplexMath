## Mandelbrot Set Renderer
This code is based on the Mandelbrot Set code #1 from
[Geeks For Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mandelbrot-fractal-set-visualization-in-python/).

MandelbrotSet.py is dependent on:

    - colorsys
    - csv
    - time
    - PIL
    - Numpy:
      - complex
      - array

Description: This code will create a Portable Network Graphics image
file (.png) of desired pixel length (input when running code) that has
the Mandelbrot Set displayed on it.
