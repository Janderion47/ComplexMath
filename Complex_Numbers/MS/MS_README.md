# Mandelbrot Set Renderer
This code is based on the Mandelbrot Set code #1 from
[Geeks For Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mandelbrot-fractal-set-visualization-in-python/).

MandelbrotSet.py is dependent on:

    - colorsys
    - csv
    - time
    - PIL
    - Numpy:
      - complex
      - array

Description: This code will create a PNG of desired pixel length (input
when running code) that has the Mandelbrot Set displayed on it. The size
and math components of the code and be changed to be compatible with
each other.
