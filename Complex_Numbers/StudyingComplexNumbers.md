## Studying Complex Numbers

Complex numbers, one of those difficult math topics your algebra or
pre-calculus teacher(I grew up in the United States) taught you and you
had no idea what it was for.

Consider, normal graphing takes a one dimensional input, and gives a one
dimensional output. Complex numbers live on the Complex Plane, where
each point on the two dimensional space is an input and the output is
graphed on another Complex Plane or on top of the original graph.
