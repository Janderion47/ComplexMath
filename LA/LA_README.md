# Lunar Arithmetic

## Understanding the math
When you addition two numbers, the sum is the number which is lower.
For example: `1 + 2 = 1`

when you multiply two numbers, the product is the number which is higher.
For example `3 * 4 = 4`

Note: This arithmetic is used only with integer values.

In [Numberphile's video](https://youtu.be/cZkGeR9CWbk),
Neil Sloan<sup>1</sup> mentions that this math is also known as "Dismal Arithmetic" as it was strange and crazy.

<sup>1</sup>An absolute respectable man

## Explaining the code
The two inputs and the one output of both functions in LunarArithmetic.py are all integers.
